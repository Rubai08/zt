Whenever I meet new people I feel the need for some common factors to exist which will eventually lead us to have a quality conversation. If there are none, then the process becomes difficult and **I am a lazy guy**. So I will always try to weasle my way out of a difficult maze of conversaions.

If you are already here at this blog, chances are you and I have some things in common. 

###*Finally some things about me*

I am Rubaiyat-E- Zaman, cuurently studying at Chittagong College in class 12.

Following are a couple of things which I find interesting: 

- Competitive programming
- Maths
- Physic
- Puzzles
- Strategies

I started doing competitve programming a couple of years ago. Now the most percentage of my working hours is spent solving CP problems(*if I am not being lazy*).
